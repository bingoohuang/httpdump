## File names or a pattern to tail.
## These accept standard unix glob matching rules, but with the addition of
## ** as a  super asterisk . ie:
##  /var/log/**.log   -> recursively find all .log files in /var/log
##  /var/log/*/*.log  -> find all .log files with a parent dir in /var/log
##  /var/log/apache.log  -> just tail the apache log file
##  /var/log/log[!1-2]*  -> tail files without 1-2
##  /var/log/log[^1-2]*  -> identical behavior as above
#  file string  usage: File of http request to parse, glob pattern like data/*.gor, or path like data/, suffix :tail to tail files, suffix :poll to set the tail watch method to poll

#  pprof string  usage: pprof address to listen on, not activate pprof if empty, eg. :6060
#pprof: :6060
